Hierarchical blocking:

  When an operation is submitted:
    - any parent/child that is submitted before me, or is processing?
    - if so, which parent/child and which exact operation of it I should wait for?

  When the blocker is resolved, the unblocked one still has to check blocking again

  => Each path stores: pending operations, last submitted operation, processing operation
  => Each pending operation is not only the operation, but has also the method to check blocking
  => Each pending operation is peeked, check blocking, dequeued to process, or not

  => To check if there is parent/child [pending] operations, a "hierarchical store" is needed
  => There can be path segment is the actual processed one, but still stored as a node
  => Such kind of node is marked with "data: null"
  => A node is only deleted in case: no operation and no children
  => Get function to delete after adding, to avoid another traverse
